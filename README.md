# Lunar_Module_Ascent_Optimiser

The program is currently a work in progress. I am trying to get pyomo to work with the ipopt NLP solver, to optimise the trajectory of a rocket going 
to orbit around moon and minimize fule. Currently, ipopt ignores (or doesn't follow) the constraints which it is given. If anyone has an idea as to 
why ipopt is ignoring these constraints, any help would be greatly appreciated :)
