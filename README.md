# Lunar_Module_Ascent_Optimiser

The program is currently a work in progress. I am trying to get pyomo to work with the ipopt NLP solver, to optimise the trajectory of a rocket going 
to orbit around the moon to minimize fule cost. Currently, ipopt ignores (or doesn't follow) the constraints which it is given. If anyone has an idea 
as to why ipopt is ignoring these constraints, any help would be greatly appreciated :)
